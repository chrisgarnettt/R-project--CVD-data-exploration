# R-project--CVD-data-exploration
RQ- What factors, both demographic and physical, are predictive of the presence of cardiovascular disease in patients experiencing chest discomfort?
This report will explore a cardiovascular disease dataset. This dataset consists of many demographic and physical factors of a sample of a group of
patients who had been referred after having complained of heart-related pain/discomfort. 
The data itself was collected before and after patients were asked to perform 10 minutes of static activity on an exercise bike. 
With a sample size of just over 300 observations for each variable and no missing data, the sample itself is quite small considering the deadliness of CVD worldwide. 
However, based on the results of this investigation, this report will attempt to determine the following question: 
What factors, both demographic and physical, are predictive of the presence of cardiovascular disease in patients experiencing chest discomfort?
